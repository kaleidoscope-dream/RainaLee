  <h2>Bio:</h2>
  <p>  Raina Lee is a high school student attending King Drew Medical/Magnet HS. She enjoys photographing family members and fellow peers, though she would love to spread her horizon of models, her teachers aren't too compliant. Ms.Lee found a passion for photography during her summer of eighth grade, while getting to playing with a friend's camera during summer camp. Though she is young and an amateur she hopes to continue growing in her passion and continue exposing herself to different forms of photography. Raina Lee's only goal is to share her passion with others through her production of photographs.
